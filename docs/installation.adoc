== Installation

=== Ubuntu

Place the file `jq-front`, `lib`, and `schema` somewhere on your `PATH`.
Following dependencies will be required by `jq-front`

* `bash`
* `jq`
* `npm`
** `ajv-cli`
* `yq`

=== With Docker (recommended)

If you are already using `docker` and `bash`, this is the easiest way to use `jq-front`.
To install docker, visit

* https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/[windows]
* https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/[mac]
* https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/[ubuntu]
* https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/[centos]

Add a following entry to your `.bashrc` or a file sourced through it (such as `.profile` on Mac OSX).

[source,shell script]
include::../jq-front_aliases[]

To install `bash` on windows, https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/[install-bash-on-windows] will be helpful.
