== What is human- and machine-readability?

What a human cares:

- Visual structure
- Number of lines
- Number of tokens
- Number of punctuations, quotes, that is... key types.


What a machine cares

- Simple parser (CFG)
- Logic to interpret the structure

- A simple "View" of a complex structure

We use the term "syntax sugar" loosely in this article, which means a syntactic construct intended to ease human effort.
