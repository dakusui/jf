== `./` jq-front: JSON with inheritance and templating

https://github.com/dakusui/jq-front[`jq-front`] is a simple tool to give your JSON files a power of inheritance and templating.
It was named after *Cfront*<<Cfront>>, which is an old component of {cpp} language that converts {cpp} source code into C language.

Despite that there are criticisms to use JSON<<json>> as system configuration information's format<<cr>>, JSON still has its beauty such as rich tool supports, good balance between machine's and human's readability and writability, clarity and simplicity in syntax, etc.

However, surely it has some weaknesses when we try to define data structure.
For instance, under a situation, where we need to generate similar but slightly different system configurations repeatedly, it is quite difficult to remove redundant pieces since JSON itself does not define anything about relationships between files or nodes inside files.footnote:[This is not merely a weakness of JSON but also other notations even YAML. YAML has a way to reference another object node from one,still it cannot embed a string value of a text node in another by itself.]

=== For what is it useful?

Haven't you ever created configuration files, each of which are slightly different?

[cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|config for foo |config for bar

|[source,json]
----
{
  "foo_database": {
    "server": {
      "ip": "192.168.1.5",
      "port": 2001
    },
    "db_name": "foo",
    "user": {
      "name": "root",
      "password": "foo_root"
    }
  }
}
----

|[source,json]
----
{
  "bar_database": {
    "server": {
      "ip": "192.168.1.5",
      "port": 2001
    },
    "db_name": "bar",
    "user": {
      "name": "root",
      "password": "bar_root"
    }
  }
}
----
|===

Probably you want to define a JSON, which defines boring default values like this,

[source,json]
.database_default
----
{
    "server": {
      "ip": "192.168.1.5",
      "port": 2001
    },
    "user": {
      "name": "root"
    }
}
----

And reuse it from other files as follows

[cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|foo.json |bar.json

|[source,json]
----
{
  "foo_database": {
    "$extends": [ "database_default.json" ],
    "db_name": "foo",
    "user": {
      "password": "foo_root"
    }
  }
}
----

|[source,json]
----
{
  "foo_database": {
    "$extends": [ "database_default.json" ],
    "db_name": "bar",
    "user": {
       "password": "bar_root"
    }
  }
}
----
|===

`jq-front` does it for you.
Try `jq-front foo.json` from your command line and you will see the `config for foo` in the first matrix.

=== YAML?

There is a criticism to use JSON as a configuration language<<cr>>.
Although I am a bit skeptical at the discussion from some view points (e.g., users will eventually end up in desiring GUI not only YAML), `jq-front` can also be used to make your YAML based configuration language more powerful.

[cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|INPUT |OUTPUT

|[source,yaml]
----
$local:
  database_default:
    server:
      ip: 192.168.1.5
      port: 2000
    db_name: test
    user:
      name: root
      password: root

# database foo differs from default by only its port and user password
foo_database:
  $extends: [ database_default ]
  server:
    port: 2001
  db_name: foo
  user:
    password: foo_root
----

|[source,yaml]
----
foo_database:
  server:
    ip: 192.168.1.5
    port: 2001
  db_name: foo
  user:
    name: root
    password: foo_root
----
|===

The command line to render the input is following.<<stackoverflow>>

[source,shell script]
----
$ yq . -j in.yaml | jq-front  | yq . -y
