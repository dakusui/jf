----

As shown, it consists of four main components, which are "file-level inheritance", "local node materialization", "node-level inheritance", and "templating".

Designs of those components will be described in the rest of this section.

For both of file-level and node-level inheritances, the inheritance mechanism (the large box in the diagram) is invoked recursively.
That is, when a file which has `$extends` attribute, the mechanism will be applied repeatedly until it reaches a file that doesn't have any.
In case a cyclic inheritance is found, `jq-front` will report it and abort.

=== File-level Inheritance

'File-level Inheritance' composes a new JSON file from a given one by expanding the files provided through the top-level `$extends` attribute.

At the end of this process, the attribute is removed and copied to the output, "Work(1)" in the diagram.

=== Local node Materialization

If the file, "Work(1)" has `$local` attribute whose value is an object node, nodes associated with keys under the attribute are dumped under a temporary directory.
The temporary directory is called 'local node directory'.
The 'local node directory' and its contents are utilized by the "node-level inheritance' mechanism.

=== Node-level Inheritance

Node-level Inheritance mechanism is a bit more complicated than the file-level one.

1. Create a base JSON object by the following procedure.
a. Scan paths of all internal nodes.
b. For each path, if it ends with `"$extends"`, expand the files specified by the attribute.
c. Assign the JSON node created in step b. to the parent of the `$extends` attribute.
2. Overlay the JSON object created in the step. 1 with an original JSON object.
3. Remove nodes, i.e., `$extends` and `$local` nodes from the JSON object created in the step 2.

'Local node directory' is inserted before the first entry of `JF_PATH` environment variable when a file to be expanded is searched during the step 1. b.

=== Templating

Templating is executed by performing `eval` on every text node whose value starts with `eval:` in JSON objects `Work(2 a)` and `Work(2 b)`.
The order where it is applied is determined by `jq` 's `path(..)` function.
Note that it is not defined in `jq` 's manual<<jq>> how keys are sorted within an object node although they seem to be sorted by dictionary order.

This happens in two steps.
The first one only processes only "keys" in the JSON object, while the second only processes the other (values and arrays).
