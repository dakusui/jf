Features beyond JSON::
In case a notation has a feature, which cannot be represented in **JSON**, this approach requires extra treatment.
For example, **YAML** allows to define entries with the same key multiple times, which is not valid in **JSON**.
In such cases, we will need to introduce a convention that interprets it into **JSON**, and converts it back to **YAML**, safely.

Application-level Syntax-sugars::
An application sometimes defines its own syntax on top of its data notation for user's convenience.
We expect such a syntax to be simplified and uniformed by applying our approach.
However, this benefit was not examined in this study.
