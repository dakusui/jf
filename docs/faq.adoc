== Why objects inside an array are rendered differently on inheritance fom ones outside?

It is because of the behaviour of `*` operator of `jq`, which treats them differently(https://github.com/dakusui/jq-front/issues/60[issue-60]).
`jq-front` relies on the operator for implementing its inheritance feature.

Maybe we should implement our own operator for inheritance in future.

The workaround for this is to have an intermediate node like following.

[source,json]
----
{
    "$local": {
      "nodeX": {
        "x":"X"
      }
    },
    "work": {
      "nodeA": {
         "$extends": ["nodeX"]
      }
    },
    "P":[
       "eval:object:$(ref .work.nodeA)"
    ]
}
