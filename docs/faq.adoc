== Why objects inside an array are rendered differently on inheritance from ones outside?

It is because of the behaviour of `*` operator of `jq`, which treats them differently(https://github.com/dakusui/jq-front/issues/60[issue-60]).
`jq-front` relies on the operator for implementing its inheritance feature.

Maybe we should implement our own operator for inheritance in future.

The workaround for this is to have an intermediate node like following.

[source,json]
----
{
    "$local": {
      "nodeX": {
        "x":"X"
      }
    },
    "work": {
      "nodeA": {
         "$extends": ["nodeX"]
      }
    },
    "P":[
       "eval:object:$(ref .work.nodeA)"
    ]
}

== Why is jq-front so slow?

It is because it's written as a bash script and creates quite a lot of process an input file.
If somebody starts a project to rewrite this in Java, for instance, I would be contributing to it!
