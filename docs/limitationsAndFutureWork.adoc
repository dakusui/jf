== Limitations and Future Work

=== File ends with `?`

With https://github.com/dakusui/jq-front/issues/138[Issue-138], now a question mark `?` in a file name has a special semantics, where it means that it is considered an empty JSON object file if the file is not found by the `jq-front`'s file searching mechanism.

For instance,

[source,json]
----
{
  "key": {
     "$extends": [ "missingFile.json?" ]
  }
}
----

Now, this produces

[source,json]
----
{
  "key": {}
}
----

Instead of giving you an error.
And currently there is no way to specify a file whose name really ends with `?`.
This semantics is only introduced in inheritances of JSON files, any other usages are not considered as of now.

=== Make it faster

The largest weakpoint of `jq-front` is its performance.
It takes seconds to process even a relatively simple and small file.

However, trying to make `jq-front` faster sacrificing the readability of it doesn't seem to me a good idea, especially in case it is written in a language which is generally considered "hard to read and debug".

Instead, we should think of implement it in another language, which is performance-wise more powerful and optimized, such as Java, C#, or whatsoever.

==== Design consideration

* Path in JSON
* Implementing the 'templating' feature.

===== Path in JSON

To implement a processor like `jq-front` requires a notation to specify a certain point in a JSON node as a string.

`jq` has such as feature out-of-box.

[source,json]
----

{ "a": { "b": 123, "c": ["HELLO"]
} }

----

The string `HELLO` in the array in the example above can be specified by a string `.a.c[0]`.

We need to choose a library that can do this sort of work or implement such a functionality by ourselves.

===== Implementing the 'templating' feature

In order to implement the 'templating' feature, we need to be able to handle a string like following.

----

    "eval:object:{"hello":"$(ref .root.greeting[0].english)"}
----
