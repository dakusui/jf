= JSON++ is All You Need

**Abstract:** In various areas of software development, to describe information with complex structures and constraints, a number of similar but different notations have been proposed and used.
This is especially frequent in configurations of distributed systems.
These notations and software products have different syntaxes and no direct compatibility.
Because of that, learning and development costs have been more expensive than it can be.
In this article, we strictly identify a notation's human-readability and capability to make documents concise are separate ones.
Then, we introduce a notation which focuses on the latter, called **JSON{plus}{plus}**.
Based on it, we demonstrate a pipeline-based approach is possible, where data defined in human-readability focused notations such as **YAML** and **HCL** are transformed into **JSON{plus}{plus}**.
Finally, it will be shown that documents written in different formats can be expressed using **JSON{plus}{plus}** syntax in a uniformed and concise way, which reduces learning cost for users and allows for application developers to focus on the core functionality of their artifacts.
